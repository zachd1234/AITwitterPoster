Knowledge work is basically whole economy. Trillions.

Humans do knowledge work.

AI brains are now as smart as human brains if not smarter. And they are faster, cheaper,  and more consistent.

This presents opportunity. Make AI do knowledge work.

There are many approaches. Human has AI assistant (human in the loop), companies hire AI as replace to human, AI company forms with zero humans.

It doesn't matter what approach. The only thing that matters is that AI contributes to knowledge work. Then there is massive value added and as a result massive value captured for who figures it out.

What is stopping AI from doing knowledge work?

- not enough context
- Can't take enough action 
- not long running and triggered (for automations)
- Not smart enough (being solved by open ai)
- Not accepted by culture (will resolve itself)
Ok. 

Context: 

There's general context. How to do certain jobs.

And specific context. Info about organizations, industry secrets, what is going on within the organization. (I think a human assistant here is the best way to get context. Basically use the human to onboard the Ai on how to do knowledge work. Because humans are the one that currently does knowledge work).

Action.

Needs APIs for everything / ways for agents to act.

Being worked on , still room for improvement. Arguably ready now , depending on the scope of work. (Obviously can't take an action like dig a hole in physical world). 

Ai to automate knowledge work is the only thing. Of the future. So if you can be part of the stack, you are big. 

 work is: Figuring out what hole to dig then digging the hole.

Break down of knowledge work. 

Figuring out what hole to dig is taking in inputs (research, prompt), and then making decisions.

Hold digging: communication to other people who need to hear it, coding, 

Can AI take action? is action figured out?

So ai can code. Ai can communicate (write the communication). And has APIs to deliver a lot of forms of communication.

Figuring out hole to dig:

Ai can research online. Ai can have access to internal context (through smart context engine). Ai has intelligence power to make decisions based on that.

I'd argue it can take action

â€” missing feedback loops. Ai might not have judgement. Maybe context engineering but there's a lot.

what does the future of knowledge work look like?


ChatGPT and Claude are already automating knowledge work as a thought assistant. 

current state of ai doing knowledge work: 

i would say, Ai can help figure out what holes to dig. it can get external context via online. you have to dig it the internal context. this is not yet mastered. then it can reason well.  now digging holes, coding and communicating. yes. it can help with these. but it is not proactive. and has to be guided by a human. its not proactive. it is not triggered. and it needs guiding. 

the fundamental limitations are that: agents are not long running. and don't have context 

end game of knowledge work:

the models will be way smarter than us and very obedient (i'm making an assumption that alignment is solved)

humans do none of it. except set the desire (philosophically, or like a consumer would) (ai goal is to serve humans. so humans figure out what they want. and maybe provide context but honestly, context might be solved. AI might have all the context it needs. but humans can contribute context.)

so i think it is organizations that are largely run by ai. entire organization structure of ai employees. that is my bet because i think it is the most efficient solution. if you have two classes of labor, one is smarter and cheaper than the other. use the second class of labor.    

even if AI could do some things, it doesn't mean it should. because we can do things too. it depends on what is best for the human.
