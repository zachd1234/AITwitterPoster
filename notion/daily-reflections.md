Today was day. Woke up, MRed then got out and watched marathon. This was cool. It was cool environment. Nathan finished and did very well. Nathan is doing good. Then, breakfast. England won. Then museums. Learned about recourse. Risk, return. And market rates. Private equity fund structure. Credit committee. MDs, and asssociares and analysts. Title inflation. Investor relations raise money. Then do deals . Take a 1% , then carry over a certain point. MDs get bonuses. And then fund owners get profit. If you set up as own entity if it goes to zero it’s fine. ManCo and funds. Ok. Art mursem. nice. Then, massages. Nice. Then, hotel. Almost went to cold plunge sauna place. Marina. Nice dinner.

Great day. Today I woke up, MRed then hit office. Then, started on Soalce. Downloaded a bunch of videos. Then set up music thing. Then did sound mixing and this took a long time. I relied heavily on vibe coding. Could have used my brain more. Then, eventually it worked and I pivoted to Twitter. Good work there. Made the basic thing work. Then, thinking about what is next. Onboarding other people. Building it into the product. Not launching a distinct saas. That’s cool and could help office mates but the goal is to help millions. That’s how we make money. So build it in this product. Which is what? What is the product? File system with a little on top? Still don’t understand. Will somehow enable non technical people . And sync to real world automatically so automatics are easy to make. Will make automations easy. Nice dinner, enjoyed being liked and enjoyed hanging out with good people. goodnight.

bus 


Tough task. Understand what the product is. Codebase. notion. ask Issac for roadmap.


Run it myself. Map out what everything does and what everything is going to do. Play with the product. Try to create and assignment and test retrieval. 


Plan assignments in ember. Just thoughts and chatGPT. On paper. 


Try to Package Twitter . And set up onboarding. So that Hubert can join 


-/ if time do solace.

Discipline today. Lean into it.


Send invoice and fix Solace. Stop at 1030. 


July 29


Today was a day. I woke up, MRed then went bus. Stepped on Dog poop. Gross. Unlucky start. Office. Bounced back and fixed solace and sent invoice in one hour. Then , worked on turning Solace into file system. also got ember running. And understood it. Turned solace to a file system and got it working. Good job. Worked diligently on this throughout the day. Very good work. Then went home. Set up solace for Gamma and it was rough. Good day though. Productive. Tomorrow let’s provide surplus value to world.

Waymo


Dilution 


Team meeting. Ask a few questions written down


When I host solace , only I will be able to use that solace. And it will be too much work for people to host themselves. So maybe GitHub actions. Actually focus on this from first principles 


Host Solace. Understand challenges then solve. 


Set up shortcut and test it. (Decide . Wait time then try again or 


Build onboarding. 


Ideally have demo able thing by end of day


Physical therapy
