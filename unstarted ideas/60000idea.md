#IDEA 

Goal shortest path to win. You can either go for win condition or draw a card â€” prepare for win condition. Start business , or learn more. But it is an optimization problem. Learn more and more until you know enough to win: then. From there, waiting and continually drawing a card, is just letting time go when you can possibly win. And trying to early is not going to work because you skip the build up.
