#IDEA 

The higher level a choice is, the less definable and objective it is. It's hard to make decisions about my life. What's good, what's bad. What should I optimize my decision for? Minimize regret? Well that's just a recursive function of your future selves values paired with hindsight. What will I care about? Not sure. Allow myself to make the mistake.
