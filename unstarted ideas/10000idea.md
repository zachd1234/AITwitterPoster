Some thoughts. We will all be out of a job. Some of those people who lose their will launch their own companies. Ai will be democratized. So being solo preenueuer is easy because they can launch entire teams of ai agents. As a result, lot of deflation . Most products will go down to almost free because so much more competition and marginal cost to zero. But some products will have moats such as network effects, data moats, ect so some stuff will still be somewhat paid. Also as a result, economic incentive massively decreases to create innovation. Ok. That's great that some humans can turn to entrepreneurship when they lose job and that is a great idea. But the reality is that most people are not creators. They are consumers. So what will they do when they are no longer useful. UBI. They will be able to watch ever more entertaining content of various mediums. So I guess that. Then what?
