Don't bite down on your mouth piece. A fighter bites down on his mouth piece, punches as hard as he can, and thinks he is doing the best he can. A tennis player sprints to every ball, swings as hard as he can and is still losing. He is going full energy. But exerting full energy, does not equal doing what's best to win. Winning is just about achieving the criteria to win, not your energy expenditure. The boxer who bites down on his mouth piece, exerts dumb energy. His muscles waste energy on contractions with themselves. He exerts energy punching the air then having to bring his arm back. In life, it is easy to think you are going full effort and it can feel really strenuous. Like you can't do a certain task for much longer. But the key is, relax your jaw. Stop biting down on the mouth piece . The task doesn't have to be strenuous, it doesn't have to be this arduous journey. You just have to achieve the win condition. And you can do it fully at ease . And just like you can clench your jaw you can also clench your mind. Overthink, too obsessed with outcome, obsess. Unclenching your mind is less exhausting and might just lead to better performance.
